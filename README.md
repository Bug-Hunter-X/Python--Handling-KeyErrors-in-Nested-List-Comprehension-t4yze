# Python Uncommon Error: Handling KeyErrors in Nested List Comprehension

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Python related to `KeyError` exceptions within nested list comprehensions and provides a solution.

## The Bug
The provided code shows a `KeyError` that may be raised not directly within the list comprehension, but somewhere within a nested data structure.  Standard exception handling won't provide sufficient context.

## Solution
The solution enhances error handling by providing more informative error messages and handling `TypeError` exceptions that might occur due to unexpected data types.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bug.py` to observe the KeyError and limited error message.
3. Compare the output with `bugSolution.py` which contains improved error handling.
